Registered office: AI My Site, 124 City Road, London, EC1V 2NX.

Contact: support@goaimysite.com

 

Platform: Hosted on Wix; payments via Stripe; CRM & email via HubSpot.

​
1) Acceptance & Scope

These Terms govern access to and use of the GoAimMySite website, dashboard, and related services (the “Services”). By creating an account, purchasing a subscription, or using the Services, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy & Cookie Policies. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company, you represent that you have authority to bind that company.

​

2) Who We Are & What We Do

GoAimMySite provides AI-assisted website analysis and recommendations to improve search rankings, traffic quality, and AI/LLM search readiness. Deliverables are advisory only; we do not change your website or third-party systems on your behalf. Outcomes depend on your implementation and external factors; results are not guaranteed.

​

3) Accounts, Access & Fair Use

You must provide accurate registration information and keep credentials secure.

Unless a plan explicitly permits, accounts are single-organisation use.

You will not (a) reverse engineer, scrape, or circumvent technical limits; (b) misuse the Services or impact their stability; (c) use outputs to create competing datasets/tools by systematic extraction.

We may use reasonable technical measures (rate limits, API guards, abuse detection) to protect the Service.

 
4) Subscriptions, Auto-Renewal, Pricing & Taxes

Subscriptions are billed in advance and auto-renew at the end of each billing period unless cancelled as set out below.

Prices are shown in GBP (or as displayed for your locale) and may change; we will give at least 30 days’ notice for subscription price increases that affect you.

Taxes (e.g., UK VAT) are added where applicable; you’re responsible for providing valid tax information and for any local taxes in your jurisdiction.

Stripe is our payment processor; you authorise us and Stripe to charge all amounts due under your plan.

 
5) Cancellation & Refunds

Cancel anytime: You can cancel from your account settings or by contacting support@goaimysite.com. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period; access continues until then.

Partial periods are not refunded.

 
6) Plan Changes

Upgrades are charged pro-rata; downgrades take effect in the next billing cycle. Features/limits are as described on our Pricing page at the time of purchase and may evolve over time.

 
7) Third-Party Services

The Services depend on third-party platforms (Wix hosting, Stripe payments, HubSpot CRM/email, and other infrastructure providers). Their availability and performance may affect our Services; we are not responsible for outages or acts/omissions of those providers. You must also comply with any applicable third-party terms.

​

8) Service Levels & Support

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services and reasonable email support during business hours, excluding maintenance windows and events beyond our reasonable control.

​

9) AI/LLM Outputs & Accuracy

AI-generated insights can be probabilistic and may contain errors or omissions (“hallucinations”). You remain responsible for reviewing, validating, and deciding whether and how to implement recommendations. The Service is informational and not legal, financial, or professional advice.

​

10) Your Content & Data

You grant us a non-exclusive licence to process your submitted URLs, metadata, and related content solely to provide and improve the Services.

You warrant you have the rights to submit the content and that it doesn’t infringe IP or violate law.

We may generate aggregated, de-identified analytics from usage to improve our Services; such analytics contain no personal data.

 
11) Intellectual Property

All IP in the Services, dashboards, models, methodologies, and know-how remains with GoAimMySite and its licensors. We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the delivered reports/recommendations for your internal business purposes while your subscription is active (and thereafter for archival/internal reference). You may not resell, publicly distribute, or create competing datasets from our outputs.

​

12) Confidentiality

Non-public information you provide that is marked confidential or should reasonably be treated as confidential will be kept confidential and used only to deliver the Services, except where disclosure is required by law.

​

13) Privacy & Data Protection

We act as a processor for personal data we handle on your behalf in HubSpot/Wix forms where applicable and as a controller for our own account/billing/marketing data. We comply with UK GDPR/UK DPA 2018 and, where applicable, EU GDPR and other local laws. International transfers rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs/IDTA). See our Privacy & Cookie Policies for details (including your rights and choices).

​

14) Security

We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and organisational measures designed to protect personal data and Service integrity. You are responsible for securing your systems, credentials, and implementation of our recommendations.

​

15) Compliance & Export

You will not use the Services in violation of applicable laws, sanctions, or export controls. You are responsible for ensuring lawful use in your jurisdiction.

​

16) Disclaimers

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties (express or implied), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

​

17) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, lost profits, lost data, or business interruption.

Our aggregate liability for all claims in any 12-month period is capped at the amount you paid to us for the Services in that period.

 
18) Indemnity

You will indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of (a) your content or websites, (b) your breach of these Terms, or (c) your unlawful use of the Services.

​

19) Suspension & Termination

We may suspend or terminate access for material breach, unlawful activity, non-payment, or security risks. Upon termination, your licence ends and we may delete your account data in line with our retention policy, subject to legal holds.

​

20) Beta/Preview Features

From time to time we may offer experimental features. They are provided as-is, may change or end at any time, and may be subject to additional terms.

​

21) Global Availability; Local Laws

We aim to make the Services available wherever Stripe supports payments. Some features may vary by region. You are responsible for compliance with local laws and taxes.

​

22) Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms periodically. If changes are material, we’ll provide notice (e.g., email or dashboard). Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

​

23) Governing Law & Venue

These Terms and any non-contractual obligations are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

​

24) Notices

Notices to GoAimMySite: support@goaimysite.com. 

Electronic communications satisfy any legal requirement that communications be in writing.

​

25) Miscellaneous

These Terms are the entire agreement, superseding prior agreements. If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder stays in effect. Neither party is liable for delay/failure due to events beyond reasonable control. You may not assign without our consent; we may assign in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.

​
